In this example we want to use a door as a fixed panel in the front.\nFirst, create your own design without the door.\nBefore you can attach the door, you will have to position the dowels. SmartWOP usually wonвЂ™t allow placement of single sided connectors, unless you activate Allow single sided connectors in the top right corner of the Machinings tab."

The use of variables within the component is highly recommended.\nClose woodWOP and return to SmartWOP.\nNote: The file is saved in the woodWOP default folder for components. Usually this would be the folder вЂњML4вЂќ within the woodWOP directory.\nYou can now drag the machining type woodWOP component onto a part of your design.\nYour component is represented with a wireframe cube, clicking on it will open the preferences.\nYou can access and edit the parameters you implemented in woodWOP in the Parameters section.\nThe arrows can be used to swap to different reference points.

(Templates have a red area on the left while preferences of already placed connectors have none)\nIn the Fitting section, you can enter the name of your new screw as well as Supplier and Article numbers, and while the name is mandatory to differentiate the screws, supplier and article number are optional.\nNow it is time to define the Screw by defining the drilling diameters.\nDiameter 1 is the boring diameter for the first panel the screw will pass through and Diameter 2 for the second panel, see the extreme example underneath for reference. Lenght is the lenght of the bore.\nOnce you are happy with your new screw dimenstions and name you can start using it right away, or hit the Floppy Disk icon to save the template (meaning all of the settings including screw count and distances will be applied the next time you use this connector) The screw itself has already been saved and can be selected from the Fitting list.\nIt is possible, that you are not the only person working with SmartWOP in your company, and that the other guy keeps on messing up your connectors вЂ“ so you have to readjust them every time. \nPrevent him from doing that by creating connectors in Administrator Mode.\nGo to File>Options>General and check the box for Administrator Mode and confirm by clicking on Apply. Now return to the Machining tab. Create another new Screw. Upon hitting Enter in the Fitting name section, you will notice an open lock icon.\nThis indicates that you have the right to change the screwвЂ™s parameters. Once you are done, either restart SmartWOP or exit the Administrator Mode by unchecking its box.\nWhen you look at the screw now, you will notice a closed lock. \nThis means, that if someone tries to change the parameters of this screw now, SmartWOP will not allow it, instead it will create a copy of it -indicated by the *.\nYour screw however can always been selected from the dropdown now, without any changes to them.\nPlease note, at this point it is not possible to have screws you created in the Screw connector category appear in the list for Screws/Dowels and the other way around. You have to create it separately for each connector type."

It is important to know, that a setback of 20 mm and a Back Panel of 8 mm means the actual Setback is 12 mm.\nOverlap determines how far into your carcass panels the back panel will insert.\nBack Panel Rebating is most helpful for thicker back panels. Front and Back will determine the distances highlighted below.\nAir Gap Width determines a gap around the rebate for easier installation.\nUnselecting Machine on CNC prevents SmartWOP from writing a program for the back panel.
