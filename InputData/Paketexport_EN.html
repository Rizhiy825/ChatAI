                SmartWOP is giving you the possibility to export NC-programs to several machines simultaneously.<br>
                This is giving you the possibility to work on one project on several machines simultaneously.

            <p>
                In order to perform an issue-free packet export, the following settings must be made in the options. <br>
                First of all you will have to create Machine Set-up Configurations and set the directories for the WOP-programs to individual paths.<br>
                As soon you created the Machine Set Set-up Configurations for all of your machines, you will have to select the machines you want to use for the packet export.<br>
                Now you can construct in SmartWOP as usual and export the NC-programs, materialists and drawings via packet export.

                <p>
                    You will have to create for every machine you want to use a Set-up Configuration.<br>
                    For creating a Machine Set-up Configuration, open the window for the Set-up customization in File-Options-General.<br>
                    In this window you will have to create machine profiles for each machine you want to use.<br>
                    In this window you also rename the machine profiles.<br>
                    If all machines got its own profile, close the Set-up customization Select each profile individually in the drop-down-menu and tick the box for packet export next to it and complete the Integration for each machine.<br>
                    When the Integration of the WOP-environment and tool data bases of all machines is done, finish the Machine Set-up Configuration by completing the settings in the Options for Workshop, Export, Tools and if needed in the Other settings.

                    As last step you will have to select the path for the export of the Export WOP for each machine in File-Options-Directories individually.<br>
                    The path for the Export WOP must be different for each machine, otherwise the NC programs cannot be exported.

                    If the project is completed you will have to export via File-Export-Machine-Packet to Machine.<br>
                    The NC-programs will be saved in the path which you entered in the Directories.<br>
                    In the drop-down-menu of Packet to Machine, can be selected if you also want to export the materialist and the drawings for the project.<br>
                    The materialist and the drawings will be exported once.<br>
                    The materialist includes all list for the different machines automatically.<br>
                    If you export with the packet export a window will appear, in which you will have to choose the path for saving the materialist and the drawings.

                    You can customize the materialist individually for your own use. To do so edit the PacketTemplate in C:\ProgramData\SmartWOP\MaterialList.
