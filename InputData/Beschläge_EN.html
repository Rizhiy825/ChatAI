               To insert a drawer fitting into your construction, you need a drawer front on which you can pull the drawer system.<br>
               Blum's summarized drawer hardware lists offers you flexible and quick choices to adapt the drawer system to your design.<br>
               The icons show you for which versions the individual data banks can be used.<br>
               The various applications are divided into frame height and for internal and external drawers.<br>
               When using the variable Blum drawer fittings, the longest possible runner length is taken into account and automatically adjusted, depending on the depth of the carcass.
