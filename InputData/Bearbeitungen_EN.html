               To insert machinings, you need items to which you can assign machinings.<br>
               You can drag and drop machinings onto the item or onto the connection area.<br>
               Machining can also be added directly for individual or all connection areas.

               To add single-sided machining, you must activate the button for the allowance of single side connectors.<br>
               Single-sided machining allows you to add any machining to your items freely via drag and drop.<br>
               If machining is added on one side, care must be taken to ensure that not only the items to which the machining has been added on one side are machined, but also those that come into contact with the machining.

            <h2>Edit machining profile</h2>
            <p>
               Machining profiles can save you a lot of time, as you can save recurring machining tasks in a profile and quickly call them up again.<br>
               In order to machine existing profiles that have a lock, you must switch to administrator mode.<br>
               You can activate administrator mode under File-Options-General directly under the drop-down menu of the machine selection.<br>
               If you have not activated administrator mode, a new profile is created as soon as the machining parameters will be changed.<br>
               SmartWOP will inform you that a new profile is being created.<br>
               To delete profiles, you must delete them individually from the profile list.<br>
               Profiles with a lock can only be deleted if you are in administrator mode.

            <b>Profile:</b> Profiles can only be customised if you are in administrator mode.<br>
            If you are not in administrator mode, a new profile is always created when changes are made for the machining.<br>
            As soon as a new profile is to be created automatically, SmartWOP will ask you whether you would like to create a new profile.<br>
            Profiles must be deleted individually from the profile list if they are no longer required.<br>
            The drilling patterns are saved within the profiles so that you do not have to adapt the drill holes for every situation, but simply select them via the profile.
