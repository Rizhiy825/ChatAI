               The icons show you for which versions the individual databases can be used..<br>
               The different applications are divided into frame height and for inner and regular drawers.<br>
               When using the variable Blum drawer fittings, the longest possible rail length, depending on the cabinet depth, is taken into account and automatically adjusted when pulling in the fittings..<br>
