When you switch to room mode, the room start bar button appears in the top selection bar.
Activate the edit mode of the room to customise the room.
Select a room edge, room corner or room side in your design.
The selected room edge or corner is marked red and the room side is marked blue.
You can adjust the edge, corner or side using the X/Y/Z coordinate system displayed on the selected element.
Individual edges and corners are extended or shortened when the dimensions are changed.
Room sides are only moved when the dimensions are changed.
As long as you are in room edit mode, room elements can no longer be selected.
