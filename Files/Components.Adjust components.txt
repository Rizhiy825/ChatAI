Inserted components can be customized on all sides via the properties window.
To do this, change the height dimension of the component.
The component is adjusted upwards and downwards in the same proportion.
The changes are taken into account when specifying the distances (distance top, distance bottom).
A customized component can be moved directly using the direction arrows in the volume.
The changes are taken into account in the distances in the properties window.
The dimensional changes can also be made directly via the dimensions of the distances.
If a dimension is changed, the opposite dimension is automatically corrected.
Lock symbols can be used to lock the component in the respective direction in the event of a size change.
If, for example, the distance at the bottom is set to 0 and locked with the lock symbol, the excess dimension is deducted from the top when adjusting the height of the component.
The dimension can only be fixed in one direction.
The actual size of the component cannot be changed by locking.
A simultaneous locking of the top and bottom distances is not taken into account.
Notice
: A component cannot be larger than the actual solid.
Changes to the size are only taken into account in reductions.
