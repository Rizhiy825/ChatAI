As long as single-sided machining is not activated, you can only mount the carcass connector if two panels are positioned with their surfaces against each other.
Pull the carcass connector onto the surface that is to receive the connection.
In the template window you will find further settings to optimise your machining.

Count:
Enter the required amount of connectors.
Step Max.:
Specify the maximum distance between the connectors.
You have the option of either specifying the count of connectors or specifying a maximum step at which the connectors should be spaced.
To do this, click on the symbol on the far right of the line.
Distances:
Specify the distances of the first and/or last connector in mm.
Click on the symbol on the right-hand side of the line to set the distances between the connectors, either to a fixed value in mm or divided into the gaps.
Column Distances:
Specify the distances of the first and/or last connector in mm.
Click on the symbol on the right-hand side of the line to set the distances between the connectors, either to a fixed value in mm or divided into the gaps.
Panel 1:
In the drop-down menu, you have the option of adjusting the holes in the cabinet joints for the first panel.
Panel 2:
In the drop-down menu, you have the option of adjusting the holes in the cabinet joints for the second panel.
Connection Area:
SmartWOP shows you the connection area of the currently selected connection.
Fitting:
Select a prefabricated accessory (connector) for the connection to add it to the material list.
The machining of the worktop connectors is related to the fitting profiles, so the machining is automatically added when the accessory is selected.
If you have not yet created any accessory profiles, enter the suppliers and article numbers so that these can be included in the material list.
