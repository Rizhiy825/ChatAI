In the base settings window of a slanted base you can enter height left, height right, width top, width bottom and angle. Dimensions that are not entered will be calculated automatically. The angle corresponds to the angle in the horizontal. To get the angle on the right side of the base enter a negative angle (‑0° to ‑90°); to get the angle on the left side enter a positive angle (0°–90°)
