As long as one-sided machining is not activated, you can only place the screws if you have a vertical panel and a horizontal panel that abut against each other.
Pull the Screws onto the joint edge that is to receive the machining.
In the template window you will find further settings to optimise your machining.

Count:
Enter the desired number of the Screws.
Step Max.:
Specify the maximum step between the Screws.
You have the option of either specifying the number of Screws or specifying a maximum step at which the Screws should be spaced.
To do this, click on the symbol on the far right of the line.
Distances:
Specify the distance of the first and/or Screws in mm.
Click on the symbol on the right-hand side of the line to set the distances between the Screw, either to a fixed value in mm or divided into the spaces.
Align Center:
Set the hook if the Screw is to be machined in the center of the edge.
If you remove the tick, you have the option of specifying the dimension to the Screw center point under the selection box.
Change the reference edge for calculating the dimension by clicking on the arrow on the right-hand side of the line.
Screw:
In the drop-down menu, you have the option of customising the Screw processing as required.
Connection Area:
SmartWOP shows you the connection area of the currently selected connection.
Fitting:
Select a prefabricated fitting (Screw) for the connectors to add them to the material list.
The machining of the connectors is related to the fitting profiles, so that the machining is automatically added when the fitting is selected.
If you have not yet created any fitting profiles, enter the supplier and the article numbers, so that these can be included in the material list.
