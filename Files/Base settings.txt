When you select a base the settings window opens. Here you can change the name of the base and select its type. Choosing a Construction kit allows items within the volume to be output to the superordinate volume when saving the volume as a component, while choosing Cabinet outputs items within the base to the base itself when saving the volume. Selecting Article outputs the items within the base as purchased parts with an article number when saving the volume; components of a volume specified as an article are not output as parts to be produced. You can change the base’s width, height and depth (including using formulas) and enter a description that is only visible in this window. The Count field specifies how many bases to produce; the number of bases appears in the material list. You can select an export reference point (front or back) to determine orientation on the machine. Under Accessories double‑click to open a submenu for adding accessories; items will appear in the purchase list. Under Transformation you can set offset and rotation values for X, Y, Z
