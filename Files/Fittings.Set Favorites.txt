You have the option of marking selected fittings as favorites so that you can quickly find them in your fittings.
To do this, select the fitting you want to set as a favorite and click on the small star with a blue border in the icon of the fitting.
To remove a fitting as a favorite, click on the favorite star again.
SmartWOP will ask you if the fitting should be removed from the favorites list.
Activate the orange favorites star under the fitting selection bar to display only your favorites in the fittings list.
Fittings that have already been combined in a variable database, such as the Blum variable pot hinges, cannot be marked as favorites.
