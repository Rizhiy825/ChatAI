Vertical drilling can be used for individual holes or for complete drilling patterns.
Drag the vertical hole onto the item that is to receive the machining.
Vertical drilling can only be used on item surfaces.
In the template window you will find further settings to optimise your machining.

Distance Mode: Start, End
Count:
Specify the required amount of free vertical drilling.
Start X:
Specify the starting point of the drilling pattern on the X-axis.
Start Y:
Specify the starting point of the boresight on the Y-axis.
Ende X:
Specify the end point of the drilling pattern on the X-axis.
Ende Y:
Specify the end point of the drilling pattern on the Y-axis.
You have the option of changing the axis for determining the start and end points using the arrows on the right-hand side of the lines.
The axis is displayed for orientation in the scene.

Distance Mode: Start, Angle
Count:
Specify the required amount of free vertical drilling.
Distances:
Specify the distance between the holes.
Start X:
Enter the starting point of the drilling pattern on the X-axis.
Start Y:
Specify the starting point of the boresight on the Y-axis.
Angle:
Specify the angle at which the holes should be located.
You can specify the angles from 0-360° or 0-90°/-0-90° depending on the orientation of the axis.
You have the option of changing the axis for determining the starting point using the arrows on the right-hand side of the lines.
The axis is displayed for orientation in the scene.

Distance Mode: Middle, Angle
Count:
Specify the required amount of free vertical drilling.
Distances:
Specify the distance between the holes.
Middle X:
Enter the center point of the drilling pattern on the X-axis.
Middle Y:
Specify the center point of the drilling pattern on the Y-axis.
Angle:
Specify the angle at which the holes should be located.
You can specify the angles from 0-360° or 0-90°/-0-90° depending on the orientation of the axis.
You have the option of changing the axis for determining the centre point using the arrows on the right-hand side of the lines.
The axis is displayed for orientation in the scene.
Diameter:
Specify the diameter of the holes in the hole pattern.
Tool Number:
Enter the tool for the holes in the drilling pattern.
You have the option of changing the diameter of the holes for the tool by clicking on the symbol on the right-hand side of the line.
Depth:
Enter the depth of the holes in the drilling pattern.
Top Side/ bottom Side:
Tick the box if you want to change the processing side of the component.
