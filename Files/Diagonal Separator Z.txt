Drag the diagonal separator Z into the base. You can drag the separator by arrows into position or enter the desired dimensions. In the settings window you will find more options to optimise your separator. Use Absolute Left Position and Absolute Right Position to determine the space of your separator relative to the base outline; the arrows allow you to switch between front and back base outside lines. Enter the desired angle (‑89° to 89°) and specify the orientation of the diagonal separator Z to bring it into the desired position
