You have the option of defining handle profiles yourself and then importing them.
To define a profile yourself, you must first create a .txt file, e.g. using Microsoft's editor.
When the file is created, you must define the contour of the profile using X and Y in the 2-dimentional.
You always determine the contour line via the contour points (X= and Y=).
The contour must first be given a starting point, e.g.(X=0 Y=0).
The contour line is always drawn directly from contour point to contour point.
The entire contour must be self-contained again at the end.
The length of the handle is not specified in the file, as it automatically refers to the entire length of the item.
