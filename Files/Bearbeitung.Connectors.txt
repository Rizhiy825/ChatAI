As long as single-sided machining is not activated, you can only mount the connectors if you have a vertical panel and a horizontal panel that abut against each other.
Pull the connector onto the joint edge that is to receive the connector.
In the template window you will find further settings to optimise your machining.

Count:
Enter the desired amount of connectors.
Step Max.:
Specify the maximum distance between the connectors.
You have the option of either specifying the number of connectors or specifying a maximum step at which the connectors should be spaced.
To do this, click on the symbol on the far right of the line.
Distances:
Specify the distances of the first and/or last connector in mm.
Click on the symbol on the right-hand side of the line to set the distances between the connectors, either to a fixed value in mm or divided into the gaps.
Housing Hole:
You can specify the desired values for machining the housing in the drop-down menu.
Housing Side:
Tick the box to change the housing opening side.
Bolt:
You can specify the desired values for machining the bolts in the drop-down menu.
Connection area:
SmartWOP shows you the connection area of the currently selected connection area.
Fitting:
Select a prefabricated accessory (Minifix) for the connectors to add them to the material list.
The machining of the connectors is related to the fitting profiles, so that the machining is automatically added when the fitting is selected.
If you have not yet created any fitting profiles, enter the supplier and the article numbers, so that these can be included in the material list.
