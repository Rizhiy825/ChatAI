If a component is called up by double-clicking, the material can also be changed individually.
Simply select items of the component and assign material.
Use the Frame function to select the entire construction and assign material.
Then save (overwrite) the component or save it with a new name as a new component.
Components that have already been assigned to a construction are not taken into account when changing the material of an entire project.
A component is to be seen as a closed system.
As long as a component is not disassembled, the material cannot be changed directly.
To change the material of an undissembled component in a project, the Add component option must be ticked in the selection window in material mode.
Only then can the material be assigned to a component or changed.
