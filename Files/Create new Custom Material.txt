To create your own material, optionally create a folder (e.g. “Own materials”) and click New. Give the material a name and specify whether it is coated board, raw material, metal, plastic or glass. Choose surface and cutting‑edge textures, adjust angles and mirrors as needed, and optionally allow grain rotation for non‑directional decors. Use Display Settings to set reflection, specular level and glossiness. You can add new panel or edge materials via the corresponding buttons
