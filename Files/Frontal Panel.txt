Drag the frontal panel into the base and position it using arrows or by entering dimensions. In the settings window you will find more settings to optimise your panel. Enter a name, determine the space of your panel relative to the base outline, specify thickness and adjust panel dimensions as needed. You can extend the panel over the base volume but cannot add panels outside the base volume
