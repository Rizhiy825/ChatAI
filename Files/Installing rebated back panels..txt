Depending on your building style you might need to change how the back panel is installed in your design. Here is how you can insert a thick rebated back panel.
This is the Back Panel Template.
It allows you to change its basic values such as Thickness and Setback. It is important to know, that a setback of 20 mm and a Back Panel of 8 mm means the actual Setback is 12 mm.
Overlap determines how far into your carcass panels the back panel will insert.
Back Panel Rebating is most helpful for thicker back panels. Front and Back will determine the distances highlighted below.
Air Gap Width determines a gap around the rebate for easier installation.
Unselecting Machine on CNC prevents SmartWOP from writing a program for the back panel. If it is selected however, you will need to determine a Tool Number in the dropdown menu which you can use with a Custom Feedrate too.
