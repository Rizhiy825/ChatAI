A component can be disassembled in order to adapt or change items or the machining of an inserted component.
A component can only be disassembled if no scaling or position locking is provided in the properties window.
All distance values must be set to 0. All lock symbols must be open.
Select the component you want to disassemble.
If all distance values are set to 0 and no locking is active, the component can be disassembled.
To do this, go to "Extras" - "Component" and click on the Dissolve button to disassemble the component.
The component breaks down into individual items that can now be changed, removed or completely redesigned.
