Click on the icon to sort your elements in the gallery alphabetically.
In sorting, the folders are sorted first and then the individual elements are sorted alphabetically.
Sorting is active when the icon is highlighted in blue.
If sorting is deactivated, the folders and elements are sorted alphabetically, but folders and elements are not separated during sorting.
