If the created project is saved via "File" or the save as option is used, the design is saved as a project.
In that case, the construction is not variably supported.
SmartWOP projects are labelled with the file extension .swp. sw stands for SmartWOP and p stands for project.
There are two options available in SmartWOP for saving a design as a variable component.
You have the option of saving the component via "File" - "Component" - "Save as" or via "Extras" - "Component" - "Save as".
The path for the storage location can be set in the SmartWOP options under "Directories".
If a valid storage path is stored under Component, this is taken into account accordingly.
