As long as single-sided machining is not activated, you can only pull on the angled connectors when two panels abut against each other.
The angle at which the items are positioned in relation to each other is irrelevant for inserting the angle connector.
Pull the angle connector onto the joint edge that is to receive the connection.
You will find further settings for optimisation in the template window. Drag the angle connector onto the joint edge that is to receive the joint.your machining.

Count:
Enter the required amount of angled connectors.
Step Max.:
Specify the maximum distance between the angle connectors.
You have the option of either specifying the number of angle connectors or specifying a maximum step at which the angle connectors should be spaced.
To do this, click on the symbol on the far right of the line.
Distances:
Specify the distances of the first and/or last angle connector in mm.
Click on the symbol on the right-hand side of the line to set the distances between the angle connectors, either to a fixed value in mm or divided into the spaces.
Housing Hole:
In the drop-down menu, you have the option of customising the machining of the housing.
Housing Side:
Tick the box to change the housing opening side.
Bolts:
You can specify the desired values for machining the bolts in the drop-down menu.
Take into account that the machining of the bolt may protrude over a workpiece.
Connection Area:
SmartWOP shows you the connection area of the currently selected connection.
Fitting:
Select a prefabricated fitting (Angled Connectors) for the connectors to add them to the material list.
The machining of the connectors is related to the fitting profiles, so that the machining is automatically added when the fitting is selected.
If you have not yet created any fitting profiles, enter the supplier and the article numbers, so that these can be included in the material list.
