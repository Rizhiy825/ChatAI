To create room design materials, create a folder (e.g. “Room design”) and click New to create a material. Give it a name (e.g. wall plaster) and choose the material type. In the Surface Texture and Section Texture columns select textures from your texture folder, optionally rotate or mirror them. For plain‑coloured materials you can allow grain rotation, but for wood decors or directional decors leave this unchecked. Under Display Settings you can set reflection levels and glossiness
