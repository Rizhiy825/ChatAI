SmartWOP components can only be created as rectangular constructions.
Constructions with diagonal items such as back angled or slanted bases are not considered as SmartWOP components.
Inserted components can be subsequently adapted and changed.
On the one hand, adjustments to the components are made via entries in the properties window.
On the other hand, a resolution of the components is possible, which can then be completely changed.
