In the drop-down menu of the upper fitting selection bar, you can rename fittings.
Select a self-defined or duplicated fitting and activate the fitting editing mode.
Now click on the third button of the drop-down menu to rename the selected fitting.
You can only rename fittings if you have created or duplicated them yourself.
