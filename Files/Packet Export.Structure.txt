In order to perform an issue-free packet export, the following settings must be made in the options.
First of all you will have to create Machine Set-up Configurations and set the directories for the WOP-programs to individual paths.
As soon you created the Machine Set Set-up Configurations for all of your machines, you will have to select the machines you want to use for the packet export.
Now you can construct in SmartWOP as usual and export the NC-programs, materialists and drawings via packet export.
