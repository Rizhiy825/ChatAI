As long as single-sided machining is not activated, you can only pull on the worktop connectors when two worktops butt up against each other at the edges.
Pull the worktop connectors onto the joint that is to receive the connection.
In the template window you will find further settings to optimise your machining.

Count:
Enter the required amount of connectors.
Step Max.:
Specify the maximum distance between the connectors.
You have the option of either specifying the number of connectors or specifying a maximum step at which the connectors should be spaced.
To do this, click on the symbol on the far right of the line.
Distances:
Specify the distances of the first and/or last connector in mm.
Click on the symbol on the right-hand side of the line to set the distances between the connectors, either to a fixed value in mm or divided into the gaps.
Housing Hole:
You can specify the desired values for machining the housing in the drop-down menu.
You have the option of adjusting the distance between the two sides as required.
Housing Side:
Tick the box to change the housing opening side.
Slot Depth:
Specify the desired slot depth for machining the worktop connectors.
Butt Joint:
Tick the box if you want a butt joint to be machined on the panels to be joined.
In the drop-down menu, you have the option of customising the butt joint as required.
You also have the option of assigning a specific tool directly to butt joint processing.
Connection Area:
SmartWOP shows you the connection area of the currently selected connection.
Fitting:
Select a prefabricated fitting (Worktop Connector) for the connectors to add them to the material list.
The machining of the Worktop Connector is related to the fitting profiles, so that the machining is automatically added when the fitting is selected.
If you have not yet created any fitting profiles, enter the supplier and the article numbers, so that these can be included in the material list.
