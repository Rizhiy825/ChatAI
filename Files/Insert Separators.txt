Before you can insert items you need a base. Drag and drop separators into the base. Work from the outside towards the inside in SmartWOP. Separators that you insert will split the base without adding panels and are required for complex constructions. If you construct panels calculated on separators you cannot delete the separator without deleting the panel. Separators used to separate panels can be linked together by selecting the panels and rightâ€‘clicking to choose link in the dropdown menu
