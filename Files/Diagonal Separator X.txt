Drag the diagonal separator X into the base. You can drag the separator by arrows into position or enter the desired dimensions. In the settings window you will find more options to optimise your separator. Use Absolute Left Position and Absolute Right Position to determine the space of your separator relative to the base outline; the arrows on the right side of the rows allow you to switch between top and bottom base outside line. Enter the desired angle (‑89° to 89°) and a safety clearance to determine how much space you want between other diagonal separators
