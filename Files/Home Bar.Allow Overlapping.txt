If you activate the button Allow Overlapping, you have the possibility to drag bases into each other.
Select the volume to be moved and move the volume to the desired position using the arrow.
This function can be useful if you have several volumes in your scene that you want to move.
By clicking the button again, overlaps are deactivated again.
Volumes that still overlap can be pushed apart again without activating the button.
