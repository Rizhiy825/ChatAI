Activate the button to hide the ceiling surfaces.
Sloping roofs are considered ceiling areas and are also hidden when hiding ceilings.
Hiding ceilings can be helpful for the construction of your piece of furniture.
The ceiling surfaces are only hidden and can be shown again at any time by clicking the button again.
