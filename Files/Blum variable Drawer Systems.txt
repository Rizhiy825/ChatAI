When inserting drawer systems using Blumâ€™s variable drawer fittings, select a drawer front and drag the fitting in. The database automatically determines the longest possible rail length based on cabinet depth. You can specify bottom indent and configure panel generation, default depth, material, rail width, back fixings and front fixings. The configurator automatically selects matching rails, frame sets, rear panel holders and front fasteners; missing parts are omitted and the rest appear in the material list
