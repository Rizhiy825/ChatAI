Before you can insert Items you will need to have a base.
Insert separators in your base by drag and drop.
Remember that you work from the outside to the inside in SmartWOP.
Separators that you enter to your construction will split the base without adding panels.
You will need separators to plan more complex constructions.
If you construct panels which will be calculated on separators you can not delete the separator without deleting the panel.
If you separate panels with a separator you can link them together by selecting the panels and right clicking to choose link in the dropdownmenu.
