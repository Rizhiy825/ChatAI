As long as single-sided machining is not activated, you can only pull on the double connectors when two panels butt against each other with the edges.
It is taken into account that if there is another panel between the joint edges, the machining of the double connector is machined into the panel that separates the two joint edges.
Pull the double connectors onto the joint edge that is to receive the connection.
In the template window you will find further settings to optimise your machining.

Count:
Enter the desired amount of double connectors.
Step Max.:
Specify the maximum spacing between the double connectors.
You have the option of either specifying the number of double connectors or specifying a maximum step at which the double connectors should be placed.
To do this, click on the symbol on the far right of the line.
Distances:
Specify the distances of the first and/or last double connector in mm.
Click on the symbol on the right-hand side of the line to set the distances between the double connectors, either to a fixed value in mm or divided into the spaces.
Housing Hole:
In the drop-down menu, you have the option of customising the machining for the housing.
Housing Side:
Tick the box to change the housing opening side.
Bolt:
You can specify the desired values for machining the bolts in the drop-down menu.
Connection Area:
SmartWOP shows you the connection area of the currently selected connection.
Fitting:
Select a prefabricated accessory (double connector) for the connection to add it to the material list.
The machining of the double connectors is related to the accessory profiles, so that the machining is automatically added when the accessory is selected.
If you have not yet created any accessory profiles, enter the suppliers and article numbers so that these can be included in the material list.
