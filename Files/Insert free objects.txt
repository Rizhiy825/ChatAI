SmartWOP allows you to insert free 3â€‘D objects for visualisation. Use the button at the bottom right to access free objects, select an object and drag it into the scene. Move it using the coordinate cross or by entering distances. With overlapping disabled, objects will snap to components; by using dimension lines you can intersect them with walls or ceilings. Free objects are visual only and do not affect CNC output or material lists
