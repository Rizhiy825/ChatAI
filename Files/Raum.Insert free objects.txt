SmartWOP offers you the possibility to draw free 3-D objects into your design and visualise them in your project.
Use the button at the bottom right of the screen to switch to the free objects.
Select the desired 3-D object and drag it into the scene.
Drag the free 3-D object to the desired location using the coordinate cross or move the element to the desired location by entering the distance dimensions in the input fields.
As long as the overlapping of elements is not allowed in the start command bar, 3-D objects on components or spatial components will be trapped when dragged across the coordinate cross.
If you move free objects to the desired position via dimension lines, they can be intersected via room walls/ceilings and building components.
Free objects are only used for visualisation and have no effect on the output CNC-programs and material lists.
3-D elements cannot be adjusted in dimensions.
