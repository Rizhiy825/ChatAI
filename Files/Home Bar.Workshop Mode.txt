In workshop mode, the numbering of the items is frozen.
Care should be taken not to make any changes to the design if the items have already been exported.
If you add or change items in production mode, only the items that have received changes are renumbered.
If you want to go back to office mode, SmartWOP will notify you that all item numbers will be recalculated.
Projects that you save in workshop mode are also recalled in workshop mode.
