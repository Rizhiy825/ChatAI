When you switch to room mode, the room start bar button appears in the top selection bar.
Switch to material mode to assign material to the floor, ceilings and walls.
Only materials that have been created for floors/ceilings or walls can be assigned to the room elements.
This means that materials designed for floors/ceilings cannot be used for walls.
You do not need to be in edit mode to assign materials to the room.
