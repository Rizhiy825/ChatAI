You have the option of renaming folders or elements in your gallery by clicking on the icon.
Select the folder or item from your gallery by clicking on it with the left mouse button.
Rename the selected element in the window that opens.
You can also change the extension by renaming the elements, so .swp (projects) can be converted to .swk (components).
The same renaming function is also available in reverse, so .swk (components) can be converted to .swp (projects).
As long as you have not selected an element in your gallery, the rename function is greyed out and cannot be used.
