In the bottom right-hand corner of the screen, you have the option of switching to your SmartWOP gallery.
In the gallery, you can enter the folder paths of the components, projects or Wop programmes and call up or drag in the saved content directly in SmartWOP.
Constructions that are used directly from the gallery can be called up by double-clicking or dragged and dropped into the scene.
Constructions in your gallery can be moved within the gallery using drag and drop.
