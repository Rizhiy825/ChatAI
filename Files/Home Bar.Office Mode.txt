In planning mode, the items are renumbered throughout.
Care should be taken not to export the items until the construction is complete.
The numbering of all items may change if you add or change items after export.
SmartWOP will ask if you want to go into workshop mode when you export all items to the machine.
Projects that you save in office mode are also opened in office mode.
