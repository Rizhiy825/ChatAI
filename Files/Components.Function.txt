Constructions that are required again and again can be created and archived in SmartWOP as variable construction components.
This makes it possible to use prefabricated systems variably in the construction of structures.
For example, you can use do-it-yourself drawer boxes.
To do this, your drawer variant is created once in SmartWOP and saved and stored as a variable component.
This component can now be arranged variably in volumes of any size.
The drawer construction automatically adapts to the assigned volume on all sides when it is pulled in.
The drawer does not have to be rebuilt again and again in every new construction.
SmartWOP components support machining (system holes), fittings such as hinges or drawer systems and materials.
This means that complete cabinet constructions can be created as components.
Many practical applications such as kitchen base units, wall units, tall units and wardrobe variants can be easily customised and used in a variety of ways.
