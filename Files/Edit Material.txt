Select a material and click Edit to modify it. You can change the material name and type (noting whether wood‑based materials are multi‑layer or single‑layer), choose new textures for surfaces and sections via the three dots, adjust angles and mirror settings, allow rotation for non‑directional materials, adjust display settings (reflection level, specular level, glossiness) and add panel or edge materials
