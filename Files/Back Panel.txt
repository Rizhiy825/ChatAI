Drag the back panel into the base and enter the desired dimensions. In the settings window you will find more settings to optimise your panel. You can enter a setback, thickness and overlap for each side. Panels can be extended over the base volume, but you cannot add panels outside the base volume. Additional options include back panel rebating, milling depth on the front or back side, machining on CNC and custom feed rates. You can define air gaps and groove extensions for each side
