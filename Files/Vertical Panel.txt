Drag the vertical panel into the base and position it using arrows or by entering dimensions. In the settings window you will find more settings to optimise your panel. Use the AbsoluteÂ Position setting to determine the space of your panel relative to the base outline; the arrow on the right allows you to switch between right or left base outside line. Enter a setback to reduce the volume for subsequent items, specify how many panels you need, define the distance between panels and set the thickness. You can extend the panel over the base volume but cannot add panels outside the base volume
