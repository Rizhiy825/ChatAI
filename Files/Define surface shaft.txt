In room mode, divide a room side for each edge of the shaft. Define the outer dimensions using the distances of the outer divided edges. Move the corner edges into position using the coordinate system or input fields. You can also split a wall twice, select the middle side, enter a setback via the coordinate cross while holding Ctrl and confirm with Enter; new edges are created and the shaft moves by the entered distance
