When adding hinges via Blum’s variable hinge databases, select a door and drag the hinge onto it. The database provides standard, wide angle and profile door hinges for inside and outside applications. You can specify the number of hinges or a maximum spacing, top and bottom distances and positions. The configurator lets you assign names for the CSV material list, filter and pre‑select cup hinges and mounting plates, and choose accessories. Outer and inner hinges can be bound to shelf bores; positions automatically align to system holes
