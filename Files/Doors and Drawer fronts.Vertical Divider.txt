Drag the vertical division into the volume.
The vertical division is for example used, so that you can construct double doors that have different door widths.
Note that if you design according to this principle, before the front is drawn in, you must bring in separators and delete the division again.
In the template window you will find further options for optimizing your workpiece.
Name:
Give the workpiece a name.
Count:
Enter the number of splits required, SmartWOP will automatically divide the number of splits evenly over the volume.
Door width:
Specify the desired measurement for each partition individually.
Thickness:
Enter the thickness of the workpiece.
Gap:
To change the gaps, open the submenu in the template window and enter the gap dimension for each side.
Overlay:
To change the overlay, open the submenu in the template window and enter for each side whether there should be an overlay on the carcass.
Distance:
Specify whether and how much to move the front/fitting outwards to the front.
Pick Point:
When inserting a component or separating a workpiece with WoodWOP, you can use the "Pick point" to define which side is to be retained as the workpiece after machining.
