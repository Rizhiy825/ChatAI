You have the possibility to mark selected fittings as favorites so that you can quickly find them in your fittings.
To do this, select the fitting you want to set as a favorite and click on the small blue bordered star in the icon of the fitting.
To remove a fitting as a favorite, click the favorite star again.
SmartWOP will ask you if the fitting should be removed from the favorites list.
Activate the orange favorites star under the hardware selection bar to display only your favorites in the hardware list.
Fittings that have already been combined in a variable database, such as the Blum variable pot hinges, cannot be marked as a favorite.
