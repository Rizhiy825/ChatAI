Pull the drawer front into the volume. In the template window you will find options for optimising your workpiece. You can name the workpiece, specify the number of drawer fronts (SmartWOP will automatically divide them evenly), enter individual heights, use fronts as separators or combine them again, set thickness, gaps, overlay, distance and chamfer, add dampers and set their position, and set a pick point for components or splitting operations
